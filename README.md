# üîë Responsive Login Page with Gradient Design

This project is a responsive login page built using HTML and CSS. The layout features a stylish gradient design on the left half of the screen and a centered login form on the right. The page is fully responsive, and on smaller screens (600px or less), the form displays on a white background without the gradient for a simplified, mobile-friendly experience.

## üéØ Project Overview

The **Responsive Login Page** is designed to be visually appealing on larger screens, while ensuring usability on mobile devices. The layout is split 50/50:

- **Left Half (50%)**: Displays a gradient background, perfect for branding or visual elements.
- **Right Half (50%)**: Contains a centered login form, featuring fields for email and password, as well as a "Remember me" checkbox and a "Login" button.

When viewed on smaller screens (600px width or less), the gradient background is removed, and only the form remains on a white background for clarity and accessibility on mobile devices.
